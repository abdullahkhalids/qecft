    "We are now in a position to introduce quantum codes. Our goal is to understand how a set of qubits transmitted through a noisy channel can be protected from any errors they experience. The process is similar to classical codes in that we will take the state of $k$ qubits and encode it into the state of $n$ qubits. However, our task will be complicated by the fact that the operations on qubits are not just bit-flips but any possible interaction with the environment, such as phase-flips or more general rotations. Fortunately, we will discover that this possibility of infinite types of errors will not be too large a hindrance and we can construct good codes."
