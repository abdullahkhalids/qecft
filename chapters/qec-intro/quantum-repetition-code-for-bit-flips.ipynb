    "We are now in a position to introduce quantum codes. Our goal is to understand how a set of qubits transmitted through a noisy channel can be protected from any errors they experience. The process is similar to classical codes in that we will take the state of $k$ qubits and encode it into the state of $n$ qubits. However, our task will be complicated by the fact that the operations on qubits are not just bit-flips but any possible interaction with the environment, such as phase-flips or more general rotations. Fortunately, we will discover that this possibility of infinite types of errors will not be too large a hindrance and we can construct good codes."

This is the replacement of the majority voting algorithm in the classical case, but quite similar.  This type of measurement does not probe the value of $\\alpha$ or $\\beta$ and therefore the superposition is maintained. Specifically Bob compares the value of the first two qubits, and compares the value of the last two qubits. If there is a difference, then he will know which error occured.
