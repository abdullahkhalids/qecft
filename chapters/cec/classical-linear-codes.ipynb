    "### Identifying and correcting errors systematically\n",
    "The previous section provided us with a way of encoding any message $m$ into a codeword $c$ which generalizes to any code. Now, we discuss a systematic method to identify and possibly correct errors that occur when the codeword is sent through the noisy channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that Bob receives the block $\\vec{\\tilde{c}}$. This block could or could not be corrupted in some way. Every code has a certain tolerance for how many errors it can correctly identify and subsequently correct. The way to see it is to recall that $\\vec{\\tilde{c}} = \\vec{c} + \\vec{e}$. The error vector $\\vec{e}$ is $n$ bits long, so there are $2^n$ possible errors. The codeword $\\vec{c}$ has some information stored inside it to help identify the error. But it also has to store the message itself. So out of the $n$ bits of information in $\\vec{c}$, $k$ bits of information is storing the message, while $n-k$ bits of information is available to identify errors. So, the code can at most identify $2^{n-k}$ different errors. For example, the repetition code can identify $2^{3-1} =$ four different errors - either no error or an error on exactly one of the three bits. Similarly, the Hamming code can identify $2^{7-4} =$ eight different errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the generic process for this? We saw in the Hamming code example that we stored some consistency checks on the message as part of our codeword. We said that the first four bits must obey some parities. Generally, in any linear code, there will be some consistency checks and will be given by a linear set of equations on the elements on the codeword. These equations are specified by a matrix multiplying the codewords, and given as follows.\n",

    "\n",
    "This definition is saying that a code consists of all the elements of the codespace that satisfy the constraint $H\\vec{x}^T = 0$. As there are $n-k$ rows to this matrix, the matrix places $n-k$ constraints on the elements of the codespace, leaving behind a $n - (n-k) = k$-dimensional space. Note that a system of linear equations can be linear transformed into another set of equivalent equations. Therefore, the parity-charity matrix is not unique. Row operations will yield other parity-check matrices for the same code.\n",
    "\n",
