    "### Identifying and correcting errors\n",
    "The previous section provided us with a way of encoding any message $m$ into a codeword $c$. Now, we discuss how to identify any errors that occur when the codeword is sent through the noisy channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that Bob receives the block $\\tilde{c}$. This block could or could not be corrupted in some way. Every code has a certain tolerance for how many errors it can correctly identify and subsequently correct. The reason for this is that all Bob can do is try to determine the *closest* codeword $c$ to the received $\\tilde{c}$. This is the best guess under the assumption that the each bit has an independent probability of being flipped. If there are too many errors, then the closest codeword to $\\tilde{c}$ is no longer the one sent by Alice, and error correction fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notion of closeness of bit strings can be formalized via the Hamming distance (not to be confused with the Hamming code; [Hamming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hamming) was just a very prolific scientist) .\n",
    "\n",
    "> The **Hamming distance** between two bit strings $s,t$ is the number of places where they have different symbols. This will be denoted $d_H(s,t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hamming distance determines the number of substitutions or errors required to transform $s$ into $t$ or vice versa. Hence, it is a very natural definition for our purposes. The Hamming distance can be calculated as\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "  d_H(s,t) = \\sum_i (s_i \\oplus t_i)\\mod 2\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The brute force method of checking if an error and which error has occured is calculating the Hamming distance between $\\tilde{c}$ and every possible codeword $\\set{c^i}$. However, there are $2^k$ codewords and we would like a more efficient process.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is done by exploiting the fact that the code has some structure in built. For instance, in the Hamming code we have recorded the parity of various subsets of the message bits. Bob should be checking if in $\\tilde{c}$ the parity bits are consistent with the information bits, and if not what is the smallest change that resolves consistency. Generically, we need a set of constraints that all codewords obey.\n",
    "\n",
    "These contraints naturally emerge when we recall that the code is a subspace of a vector space, and therefore it is the kernel of some linear transformation. This transformation, which we will call $H$, maps the codewords to zero.\n",

    "\n",
    "As there are $n-k$ rows to this matrix, the matrix places $n-k$ constraints on the elements of the codespace, leaving behind a $n - (n-k) = k$-dimensional space.\n",
